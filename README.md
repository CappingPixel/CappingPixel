Hi im just a random dude who likes coding, i've been doing it for 2 - 3 years and am thinking about making an app on the appstore soon! I specialise in python with my main module being Pygame, but I can operate fluently with tkinter, object oriented programming, as well as a completely different coding language proccessing.js!
